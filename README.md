Once it finishes, click Finish to launch VirtualBox.

 TROUBLESHOOTING INSTALLATION ISSUES
üîπ Problem: Missing Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable
If VirtualBox doesn‚Äôt open or throws an error, you may need a system library.

Download and install this file:
üîó https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe

Then restart the VirtualBox installation.

Inside BIOS, find Virtualization Technology or SVM Mode under Advanced Settings, and enable it.

 Step 2: Installing 7-Zip
Right-click the downloaded 7z2500-x64.exe file and choose Run as Administrator.

When the installer opens, click Install.

After it‚Äôs done, click Close.

 Step 3: Extract the Kali Linux Image
Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the .7z file for Kali.

Right-click the file, go to 7-Zip > Extract Here.

This may take a few minutes. Once finished, you'll see the extracted VM files.

 Step 4: Load Kali into VirtualBox
(Optional but recommended) Move the extracted Kali files to a separate partition with ~10‚Äì15 GB free space.
A tutorial if needed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGqo17dGk0E

Inside the extracted folder, locate the file with a .vbox extension ‚Äî this is the VirtualBox machine definition file.

Double-click that file. It will automatically open in Oracle VirtualBox.

Click the Start button to boot up Kali Linux. First-time startup may take some time.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Why It Matters**

In ethical hacking, reconnaissance helps in:

* Finding weak points before an attacker does
* Strengthening defenses proactively
* Simulating real-world attack planning for better security

---
1. Low Privilege User
Definition:
A low privilege user is an account configured with minimal permissions necessary to perform its intended tasks. This is a core part of the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP), which ensures that users can only access what they strictly need.

Characteristics:

Cannot install software or change system-wide configurations.

Limited access to files and directories (e.g., only their home folder).

Restricted from managing other users or system processes.

Cannot access sensitive system logs or security settings.

Examples:

Windows: Standard User account vs. Administrator.

Linux/Unix: Non-root user (e.g., student account with no sudo rights).

Corporate Environment: Employee account without admin rights on their workstation.

Security Benefits:

Reduces damage in case of account compromise.

Prevents unauthorized installation of malicious software.

Limits insider threats by restricting unnecessary access.

Risks:

Even with low privileges, attackers can:

Steal accessible data.

Use the account as a foothold to attempt privilege escalation.

Participate in lateral movement within the network.

2. SOC (Security Operations Center)
Definition:
A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a dedicated team and facility that monitors an organization‚Äôs IT infrastructure to detect, analyze, respond to, and prevent cybersecurity incidents.

Key Objectives:

Continuous monitoring: 24/7 real-time observation of security events.

Incident detection: Identifying unusual or malicious activity.

Incident response: Containing and mitigating active threats.

Threat intelligence: Using external and internal sources to anticipate attacks.

Compliance: Ensuring security standards meet legal and regulatory requirements.

SOC Structure:

Tier 1 ‚Äì Alert Monitoring & Triage

Receives alerts from SIEM systems.

Filters false positives.

Tier 2 ‚Äì Incident Investigation

Deep analysis of suspicious events.

Determines impact and scope.

Tier 3 ‚Äì Threat Hunting & Response

Proactive search for hidden threats.

Develops detection rules.

SOC Manager

Oversees operations.

Coordinates incident communication.

Common SOC Tools:

SIEM: Splunk, IBM QRadar, ArcSight.

Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR): CrowdStrike, SentinelOne.

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): Snort, Suricata.

Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs).

Example Workflow:

SOC receives alert from SIEM.

Analyst checks logs for unusual login activity.

Incident escalated if suspicious.

Response team isolates affected system.

Incident is documented for future prevention.

3. Data Exfiltration
Definition:
Data exfiltration is the unauthorized transfer of sensitive data from within an organization‚Äôs network to an external location controlled by an attacker.

Common Targets:

Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

Financial data.

Intellectual property.

Login credentials.

Methods of Data Exfiltration:

Manual methods: Using USB drives, CDs, smartphones.

Over the network:

Emailing to personal accounts.

Uploading to cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox).

Using file transfer protocols (FTP, SFTP).

Covert channels:

DNS tunneling.

Embedding data in images (steganography).

HTTPS traffic to hide malicious transfers.

Causes:

Insider threats.

Compromised credentials.

Malware infections.

Exploiting unsecured APIs.

Detection Techniques:

Monitoring unusual network traffic volume.

Detecting uploads to unknown domains.

Data Loss Prevention (DLP) systems.

Prevention:

Enforce encryption for sensitive data.

Use DLP solutions.

Apply strict access controls.

Employee awareness training.

4. Privilege Escalation
Definition:
Privilege escalation occurs when an attacker gains higher-level permissions than initially granted, allowing them to perform unauthorized actions.

Types:

Vertical Privilege Escalation:
Gaining higher privileges than assigned (e.g., user ‚Üí admin/root).

Horizontal Privilege Escalation:
Accessing resources of another account with the same privilege level (e.g., user A accessing user B‚Äôs emails).

Techniques:

Exploiting unpatched software vulnerabilities.

Weak or misconfigured file permissions.

Credential theft (pass-the-hash, keylogging).

Exploiting SUID binaries in Linux.

DLL injection or malicious service creation in Windows.

Example Attack Path:

Attacker compromises a low privilege account.

Exploits vulnerability to gain administrator rights.

Accesses sensitive files or deploys malware.

Potentially performs data exfiltration.

Mitigation:

Apply timely patches and updates.

Enforce PoLP for all accounts.

Monitor logs for unusual privilege changes.

Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

Implement Privileged Access Management (PAM) tools.

How They Connect in a Real Attack
Initial Access ‚Äì Attacker compromises a low privilege user (via phishing or stolen credentials).

Privilege Escalation ‚Äì Attacker gains higher privileges to access more resources.

Data Exfiltration ‚Äì Sensitive files are copied to attacker-controlled servers.

SOC Detection ‚Äì SOC detects unusual activity, investigates, and responds
